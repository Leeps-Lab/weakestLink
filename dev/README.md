#The update time is slow
check how many messages are being sent,
and if there is a way to optimize the number of messages sent


#Currently
There is a delay; was a delay between the machines

#Plan
Instead of calculating the payoffs at each tick, calculate them when
someone clicks and the point is set. (When point is set, disable click)
