#The update time is slow
check how many messages are being sent,
and if there is a way to optimize the number of messages sent


#Currently
There is a delay; was a delay between the machines

Correction, there is no delay, but in fact the machine's ticks are slow, 
so then when the person moves the mouse arround, it accelerates the
process of the movement of the position.

#Plan
Instead of calculating the payoffs at each tick, calculate them when
someone clicks and the point is set. (When point is set, disable click)

make the frequency so high that when the mouse moves, it becomes
unnoticable.

scratch that, need to sync all the values
send message every time plothover is called?
